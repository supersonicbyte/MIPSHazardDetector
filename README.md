# MIPS Hazard Detector

MIPS delayed branch detector is a simple Java solution. The program with a given input of MIPS intructions in .txt checks control hazards in the sequence and generates suggested
halt instructions in an output file. The solution was developet by Robert Tomas, Allen Kovačević and myself as a task at [Faculty of Electrical Egineering Sarajevo](http://www.etf.unsa.ba/)
